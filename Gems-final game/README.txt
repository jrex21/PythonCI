Final Game: Gems

a. System Requirements:
    i. This game was created on Windows using Python IDLE and PyGame
   ii. Python Version 3.3.3 was used: www.python.org/downloads
  iii. PyGame Version was used: https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/downloads
  
b. Installation Instructions
    i. In order to run the program, the files gem*.tif, where the * is a number 1-9,
	gems.py, Kleymissky_0283.otf, and hangman.py should all be in the same folder. 
		
c. Source Code links (GitHub)
	everything can be found in the following file on GitHub:
	https://github.com/jrex21/PythonCI/tree/master/Gems-final%20game

d. Imported Classes
	random
	pygame
	sys
	copy
	time
	pygame.locals
	
e. Game Tutorials (GitHub links)
    i. Set up/ creating a basic window
   ii. Loading images
  iii. Responding to a mouse click

    All of these tutorials are very simple, and should be able to be completed 
    with minimal prior knowledge. A knowledge of loops and some basic terminology
    should suffice. The video can be found in the same GitHub location listed 
    above. 

f. Other Resources
    I used the following video to solve my problem with using the wrong version of
    pygame with the version of Python I had. I also used the links in this video:
	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao_S-3FmCQ0

    StackOverflow.com was used for various questions and to look up basic information.

    Python.org and Pygame.org for function definitions.
